# Selecting Instances in Jexplorer

Selecting instances works basically the same way as Roblox's default explorer.

Left click to deselect the current selection and select a new instance,

control + left click to toggle selection on an instance,

shift + left click to select all instances inbetween the just-selected one and your last selected one.
