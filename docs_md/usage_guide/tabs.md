# Tabs

Tabs are a way for you to configure the root instances (or so called "services") that are displayed within your Jexplorer widget.

To add a new tab, simply click the "+" button on the very top left of the Jexplorer widget, this will add a new tab called "Tab".

To add new top-level instances to your new tab, simply click the "+" button inside it.
This will redirect you to the "All" tab, where you can select all the instances you want as top-level instances in your new tab, and click `Enter` to add them to your tab and go back to it.

To switch between tabs, simply click between them in the tab bar which is on the very top of the Jexplorer widget.

Another way to add instances into your tab is to drag-and-drop it into the tab button itself

To remove an instance from your tab, use the "Remove from Tab" context menu action which is located at the very bottom for the default Instance context menus.
