# How to Use The Search Bar

Before reading this page, you should read the page for [JQL](../formats_and_languages/JQL)

The search bar is a little textbox positioned on the top of the plugin widget which allows you to query for instances meeting specific conditions.

In order to use it, you simply have to type in your desired condition for your instances in JQL into the search bar, then click enter to query it.

Once you've clicked enter, all instances matching your condition will be displayed like in the default explorer.

You'll see that on the right edge of the search bar, there is a number indicating how many instances matched your query, and a little magnifying glass button which when clicked will select all instances that matched your query.
