# The Style Editor

The style editor allows you to edit internal style & tokens and also create your own custom ones.

## Creating a StyleRule

Creating a StyleRule is very simple, simply click the "+" button on the "StyleRules" dropdown header and it'll open a menu in the main Jexplorer widget prompting you to input a Selector and a Priority in order to create a custom style.

Once you click the Create button, a new style called CustomStyle will appear in the bottom of the StyleRules list.

## Removing a StyleRule

To remove a StyleRule, simply click the "-" button in its dropdown header.

## Adding a Subrule

To add a StyleRule inside another StyleRule, click the button with the StyleRule icon inside the dropdown header of your parent StyleRule (its next to the "+" button) and it'll open the StyleRule creation menu in the Jexplorer widget, just like creating top-level StyleRules.

## Adding a Token

To add a token (which is just a reusable value, to learn more you should check out the Roblox Styling API docs since the concepts are 1:1 applicable here) you can click the "+" button in the "Tokens" dropdown header, which is below the "StyleRules" one.

This will open a menu in the Jexplorer widget prompting you to input a name and a value, and this will be your token which can be used in any StyleRule inside the style editor.

## Removing a Token

To remove a token, again just click the "-" button beside it.
