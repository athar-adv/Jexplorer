# Instance Visibility Editor

The instance visibility editor is the editor you use to trigger the visibility of certain classes in the Jexplorer widget.

You can input a JSON indicating if an instance class is invisible or not, or you can use the dropdown list where you can click on a specific class to toggle visibility for it.
